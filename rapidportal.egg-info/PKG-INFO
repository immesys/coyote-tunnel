Description: So we suffered some feature creep and this might take marginally longer to implement than originally anticipated...
        
        The idea is, we are going to have multiple drivers made by multiple people. Some of these people may 
        have no idea about how to set up a server, and many of the things being controlled can be done
        remotely (i.e we are just federating existing APIs). Why not have a platform for simply deploying
        drivers?
        
        In the short term, this is more about making it easy to deploy a given branch or commit in
        such a way that it won't bother anyone else if the code is shoddy and crashes all the time, yet is
        still available to everyone and is still based off the central repo.
        
        
        Please refer to the github commits for detailed changes.
